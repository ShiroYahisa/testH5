	<h1>Ozymandias</h1>
	<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
	<p>I met a traveller from an antique land <br/>Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone <br/> Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand, <br/>Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br/> And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command, <br/>Tell that its sculptor well those passions read <br/> Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things, <br/> The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed; <br/> And on the pedestal these words appear:<br/> “My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings: <br/> Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!” <br/> Nothing beside remains. Round the decay <br/> Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare <br/> The lone and level sands stretch far away.</p>
